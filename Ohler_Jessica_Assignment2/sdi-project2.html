<p>A time traveler chooses to either travel with or without his companion.  
Then either with his lover, Joie, and friend, Jabba the pug.  They end up traveling to 
the year 25 on another planet.  When they land an alien approaches them and starts to 
attack because they feel their space is invaded.  The time traveler (and companion) then 
fight the alien.  The aliens health finally falls to 0 and they are all worn out after the 
long battle.  The time traveler (and companion) decide that was enough adventure for one 
day and decide to head back to the year 2000 which was their starting point.  Laughing the 
time traveler asks his companion if they would like to join them on another journey again.</p>
<p>In my code I had done the returns to output information that caused it to be placed in console twice. 
I was not sure if that we were supposed to output info and return it to show both so I left it twice.</p>
